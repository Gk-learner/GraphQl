# GraphQl using Apollo server

####GraphQl is a QL to request or mutate data. 
Its an alternative to REST Api. 
Gives good control on what data we want to fetch and the ability to nest any reated data we need in a singal request instead of making mulitple query as we might do in RESTAPI
RESTAPI sends http request with endpoints. 
Its drawback
overfetching data (more than required) from a large set
underfetching (we need to hit different endpoints to get data that we need)
